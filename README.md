# Cube-Extrusion

## About
This project is a demo in babylon.js to create a box/cube and extrude its sides/faces to make different size of cuboids/boxes.

## How to run?
Step 1. run `npm install`

Step 2. run `npx parcel index.html`

This will start a local server on `http://localhost:1234/` from which will load the index.html file.

*Note pressing 'r' key on the keyboard will reset the scene and the box will be set back to its default size and position*
